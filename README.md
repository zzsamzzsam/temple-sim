# temple-sim
path of exile target room simulation

The assumptions:

- There are 22 rooms (spirits and box room added | no map and no atziri room) (running a zone like act 9 quarry)

- Any room at the beginning has a 50% chance to become any t1 room

- Any room can be selected to be the "swap" room

- There is no weighting on rooms or tiers

- Once a room has shown up in the temple or as an option, it will not show up again



The limitation:

- Does not factor in room locations, thus not factoring in the Shrine of Empowerment boost



The rules:

- If empty room, select target room if possible, otherwise pick any

- If not empty, select target room if possible, otherwise upgrade


Preset:

- 10 sets of simulations

- Each set is 1 000 000 temples
